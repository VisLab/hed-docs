There are various tools supporting HED tagging. If you are EEG an researcher and are familiar with the Matlab toolbox [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), you can install the EEGLAB 'HEDTools' plug-in. Alternatively, you can also prepare a spreadsheet containing event codes and their associated HED tags and use the 'HED validator' to confirm your tagging.

## Using HEDTools plug-in for EEGLAB
There are two ways to install the HEDTools EEGLAB plug-in:
1. In EEGLAB, go to File > Manage EEGLAB extensions. Look for HEDTools and install it.
2. Alternatively, you can download the [plug-in zip file](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/tree/master/EEGLABPlugin) and extract it into EEGLAB *plugins* folder. Restart EEGLAB.

Check out the [Quick guide](quick-guide.md) to start tagging your EEG data.

## Using spreadsheet and HED validators
Follow instruction on the [HED validator page](http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/hed/help) to prepare your event-HED tag spreadsheet and validate it with the HED validator.

## Tagging Strategy Guide
Once you are familiar with these ways to add HED tags to your data, check out our HED [Tagging Strategy Guide](docs/HEDTaggingStrategyGuide.pdf) to get a quick start on tagging your data.

HED was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). HED development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Laboratory (ARL).
