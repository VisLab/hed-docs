There are various tools supporting HED tagging. If you are EEG researchers and familiar with the Matlab toolbox EEGLAB, you can install HEDTools plugin for EEGLAB. Alternatively, you can also prepare a spreadsheet containing event codes and their associated HED tags and use HED validator to confirm your tagging.

## Using HEDTools plugin for EEGLAB
There are two ways to install HEDTools EEGLAB plugin:
1. In EEGLAB, go to File > Manage EEGLAB extensions. Look for HEDTools and install it.
2. Alternatively, you can download the [plugin zip file](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/tree/master/EEGLABPlugin) and extract it into EEGLAB plugins folder. Restart EEGLAB.

Next, check out [tutorials and documentations](/eeglab)  on HEDTools to start tagging your EEG data.

## Using spreadsheet and HED validators
Follow instruction on the [HED validator page](http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/hed/help) to prepare your event-HED tag spreadsheet and validate it with the HED validator.

## Tagging Strategy Guide
Once you are familiar with the tools to create HED tags, check out our [strategy guide](/pdf/HEDTaggingStrategyGuide.pdf) for a quick guide on how to start tagging your data.

HED was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). HED development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Laboratory (ARL).
