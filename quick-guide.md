Most people who worked with EEG data are familiar with the practice of using lab-specific labels or arbitrary integers to annotate what and when events happened during an experiment. Re-using a collected dataset for new analysis means reading carefully the experiment description to understand the meaning of those event codes. Meanwhile, the success of data sharing efforts have now allowed EEG researchers to access an increasing number of dataset from many studies, which also made this manual reading process ever more debilitating. Moreover, the lack of details expressed in an event code prevents researchers from flexibly combine events across studies using the nature of experimental events, nor able to be effeciently evaluate which events to be included in their analysis. These constraints make the exploration of applying recent advances in machine learning for large-scale EEG analysis infeasible.

Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) provides a standardized way to describe precisly the nature of the experimental events. With HED-annotated datasets, researchers will easily undertand the meaning of event codes without even reading the experiment description. Moreover, analysis tools will be able to aggregate events across a large number of studies with minimal human supervision. The HED system comprises of a schema and the software ecosystem supporting the annotation, validation, extraction, and analysis of EEG events using HED tags. The [HED schema](http://www.hedtags.org/display_hed.html) specifies the collection of HED tags to annotate events, organized in a hierarchical structure. HED-supporting software currently includes the EEGLAB plug-in [HEDTools](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/tree/master/EEGLABPlugin), the tagging program [CTAGGER](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-java/blob/master/java/tagging/CTagger.jar) (which is also bundled with the EEGLAB plug-in HEDTools), and online [HED validator](http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/hed/validation).

This guide will focus on the EEGLAB plug-in *HEDTools* for event annotation, extraction, and validation using HED tags. After this guide, you will be familiarized with the HED schema and how to associate HED tags with your events. You will also see how you can use HED-annotated events for your analysis. These knowledge will transfer beyond the EEGLAB environment, and you can use any other tool system to work with HED.

## <a name="I">I. Event annotation & extraction with EEGLAB plug-in *HEDTools*</a>
#### <a name="I.1">1. What is EEGLAB?Â Setting up the plug-in</a> 

EEGLAB is one of the most widely used EEG analysis tool. It combines both graphical user interface and command-line, which is friendly for both beginner and those who prefer a more flexible, automated way of analyzing data. For more information about EEGLAB, check out its webpage [here](link). 

The plug-in *HEDTools* can be installed using one of the following ways:

1. From the EEGLAB Plug-in Manager: Launch EEGLAB and go to **File -> Manage EEGLAB extension**. The plug-in manager GUI will pop up. From this GUI look for and select the plug-in *HEDTools* from the main window, then click into the Install/Update button to install the plug-in.
2. From the web: Download the zip file with the content of the plug-in *HEDTools* either from [GitHub](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-matlab/blob/master/EEGLABPlugin/HEDTools2.5.0.zip) or from the EEGLAB [plug-ins summary page](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/plugin_uploader/plugin_list_all.php). Decompress the zip file into the folder *../eeglab/plugins* and restart EEGLAB.

#### <a name="I.2">2. Load dataset and start tagging</a>

Once you have EEGLAB main window opened, load the dataset into the software. For this quick guide, we are using the EEGLAB tutorial dataset, which you can download [here](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/images/9/9c/Eeglab_data.set). Click on **File > Load existing dataset** and select the dataset. 

For a description of the dataset and the meaning of event codes, we check its description by selecting **Edit -> About this dataset**:

<img src="images/I15about_this_dataset.png" alt="I15about_this_dataset" style="zoom:100%;" />

Our goal is to use HED tags to describe events, so that anyone who will reuse the dataset in the future won't need to read the description again.

#### <a name="I.4">3. Adding tags using CTAGGER</a>

From EEGLAB menu, select **Edit -> Add/Edit event HED tags** which will bring up a window to specify options for tagging:

<img src="images/image-20191218122111785.png" alt="image-20191218122111785" style="zoom:50%;" />

We'll proceed with the default options which uses the latest version of the official HED schema. It also assumes that you are tagging the dataset for the first time and not re-using any previous tagging scheme. Lastly, you will use CTAGGER and event field selector panel for tagging. Hit **Ok**. 

A window will pop up to let you choose which event field to use for tagging:

<img src="images/image-20191218122321698.png" alt="image-20191218122321698" style="zoom:50%;" />

Fields listed in the select box are extracted from the EEG.event fields, ignoring fields "latency", "epoch", and "urevent". *Primary field* is the field used to specify what kind of event is occurring while the other fields are subfields used to specify conditions or subcategories within the event. In most cases with EEGLAB, "type" is the primary field which is also the first field we want to tag. Select "type" in the select box and click **Tag** which will open up CTAGGER:

![image-20191218122404111](images/image-20191218122404111.png)

CTAGGER was built to facilitate the process of tagging. On the left side, we have the **Data Events** panel containining values of the selected event field and their associated tags. The right panel **Schema Tags** contains all available tags organized in the hierarchical structure as defined by the HED schema. The process of tagging is simply choosing tags from the schema to associate with an event value. 

First we'll add a short label and a detailed description to the event codes using tag *Event/Label* and *Event/Description*. These tags are meant for human readability and will be ignored during machine processing. A restriction with HED tags is that tag value should not contain any comma, which is a common mistake with event description. Next, we want to generally categorize these events using tag *Event/Category*. "square" is a stimulus presentation event so we'll use tag *Event/Category/Experimental stimulus* and "rt" is subject's response so we use tag *Event/Category/Participant response*. 

![alt text](images/event-label.gif)



With those three information, the dataset can now be shared and researchers who re-use the dataset can quickly understand the meaning of the event codes. However, the power of HED is that you can finely detail the nature of the events so that analysis tools can automatically aggregrate events using tags with minimal human supervision later on. So let's keep tagging.

Let's start with partcipant responses events. We denote the type of action participant performed using *Action/* tags. In this case, it's *Action/Button press* since subject was asked to press a button when they see the target stimulus. We can go to further details in describing the body part affected by the action. In this case the subject was asked to use the right thumb to press the button. We'll first add a tag group to **rt**. A tag group contains a main tag and *Attribute/* tags that describe the main tag. Searching for keyword "thumb" in the HED schema shows *Participant/Effect/Body part/Arm/Hand/Finger/Thumb*. We add the tag to the group. Similarly, searching for "right" shows multiple results yet we care only about ones with *Attribute/* prefixes. *Attribute/Object side/Right* seems to be the right tag. Clicking on the tag brings us down to the location of the tag on the HED schema. Hovering over "Object side" shows the tag's description on tooltip: "Could be the left, right, or both sides of a person or a vehicle" which confirms our presumption. So we add the tag to the group and complete describing the participant response events.

We will next describing stimulus events. We'll describe how the sensory was presented to the participant using */Sensory presentation/* tag. In this case a visual stimulus was presented on a 2D screen so we use */Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering type/Screen/2D*. We also want to describe the expected effect of the stimulus to the participant using *Participant/Effect/* tags. We want the subject to see the stimulus so we add tag *Participant/Effect/Visual*. Even better, we can use tag *Participant/Effect/Visual/Foveal* to denote that subject focused foveally on the stimulus presentation. 

![alt text](images/square-stimulus.png)

We also want to describe the stimulus presentation itself. In this study, the stimulus is a filled circular disk appearing randomly in one of five green-outlined squares spaced evenly on a horizontal plane above the center fixation cross. For the tutorial sample dataset, we only include trials in which the disk appeared in the two left-most squares, annotated by event field "position". Thus to also include position information of the stimulus, we will switch to tag field "position". As we have finished tagging field "type", hit *Ok* on the current CTAGGER window. The field selection window becomes active again, and this time we choose "position" before hitting **Tag**. CTAGGER will appear again and this time with "position" event values "1" and "2", indicating stimulus appeared in the square at about 5.5 degree and 2.7 degree of horizontal visual angle respectively. 

![](images/select-position.gif)



A stimulus includes a circular disk and the green square so we'll use two groups to describe them separately. We'll first describe the bounding square. Click on the checkbox next to button "Add new tag group" to select both values and then click the button to add a group to both of them. Select the two newly added groups. We use tag */Item/2D shape/Rectangle/Square* and */Attribute/Visual/Color/Green* to describe the green square. We can also denote the area of the square using tag */Attribute/Size/Area*. Clicking on the tag will pop up a window prompting for a value. We enter "1.6" as the value and select "cm2" as the unit, rendering a complete tag */Attribute/Size/Area/1.6 cm2*. 

![tag-position-1](images/tag-position-1.gif)



We also wants to include information about their positions. For event value "1", we'll add tags *Attribute/Location/Screen/Center displacement/Horizontal/2.7 degrees* and *Attribute/Location/Screen/Center displacement/Vertical/1.8 degrees* to describe horizontal and vertical visual angle respectively. For event value "2", we'll add *Attribute/Location/Screen/Center displacement/Horizontal/5.5 degrees* and *Attribute/Location/Screen/Center displacement/Vertical/1.8 degrees*. We have just described the green square.

![tag-position-2](images/tag-position-2.gif)



We'll add a second group to describe the circular disk. Similar to tagging the square, we'll add tags */Item/2D shape/Ellipse/Circle*, */Attribute/Visual/Color/Black*, and */Attribute/Size/Area/1.4 cm2* to describe the disk and  *Attribute/Location/Screen/Center displacement* tags to describe its position accordingly.

![](images/tag-circular-disk.png)

You just finished tagging the dataset! *HEDTools* will generate the final HED string for each event by concatenating all tags associated with the event values of that event, seperated by commas, and put the string in a new field **usertags**. From now on you can use these tags to extract epochs for your analysis and  with other HED-annotated dataset you can do meta-analysis!
